# What is the nextcloud api library?
> Use nextcloud features from inside your java application

# Currently implemented features
- Management of groups
- Folder management (Without access control)
- List shares and create new file shares (No way to delete/update shares atm.)
- Tested against nextCloud 16.0.4 server version, but should also work with older nextCloud and ownCloud systems

# Usage
- Add this dependency to your pom.xml file
```
<groupId>org.aarboard.nextcloud</groupId>
<artifactId>nextcloud-api</artifactId>
<version>11.1.0</version>
```

- Create a NextcloudConnector instance and provide your server settings and authentification
- Now you can use the methods exposed to access your nextcloud instance
